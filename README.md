# MyBooking

Project by Asimakis Kydros (srn: 3881) and Vaggelis Dimos (srn: 4038)

Project header*:

Create a rudimentary Booking.com clone in Java. At the bare minimum, your app should support:
* Customers, who can search through the available listings, make and cancel bookings
* Providers, who can upload, edit and delete their accomodation types
* Administrators, who can interact with the database directly and send messages to the users.
* 3 accommodation types: apartments, maisonettes, hotels
* Login and registration mechanisms
* Booking and cancellation mechanisms
* Forms to upload, edit and delete accommodation types as eligible provider
* Built-in messenger so the admins can contact the userbase
* A basic GUI
* A basic database

Provide pre-built examples of users and accommodation types to show everything working approprietly.

Notes:
* src/data/Initializer clean-wipes the database and re-initializes the entire app (developer tool)
* src/GUI/RegistrationLogin_MAIN is the assigned start so the program runs as intended
